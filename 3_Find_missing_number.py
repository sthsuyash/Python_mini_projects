# Find Missing Number using Python
# Finding the missing number in an array means finding the numbers missing from the array according to the range of values inside the array.
# Most of the time, the question you get based on this problem is like:
# # Given an array containing a range of numbers from 0 to n with a missing number, find the missing number in the input array.
# To find the missing number in an array, we need to iterate over the input array and store the numbers in another array that we didnâ€™t find in the input array while iterating over it.

def findMissingNumber(arr):
    numbers = set(arr)
    length = arr[-1]+1
    output = []

    j = 0
    for i in range(1, length):
        if i not in numbers:
            output.append(i)
            arr.insert(j, i)
        j += 1
    return output


listOfNumbers = [1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 8, 9, 12, 14, 15, 15, 20]
print(f"\nMissing Numbers:\n{findMissingNumber(listOfNumbers)}")
print(f"\nList of Numbers:\n{listOfNumbers}")
